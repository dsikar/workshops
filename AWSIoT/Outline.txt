Skillsmatter IoT 2-day course

* course outline

Data generated by actuators, embedded devices, sensors and smart appliances is becoming available online by default. The world is connected and opportunities arise as companies are hiring whoever can deal with it from any side of the equation, being an IoT data generator or consumer or both.

This course is aimed at professionals and enthusiasts looking to transfer skills to gain an understanding of the entire IoT stack.

By making use of the AWS (Amazon Web Services) ecosystem you will be able to quickly develop complete IoT solutions from the embedded device to the Cloud, as well as gain a level of understanding that will enable the development of your own bespoke IoT solutions outside the AWS environment.
